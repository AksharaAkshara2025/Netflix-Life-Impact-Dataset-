# Netflix Life Impact Dataset (EDA Project)

## Project Overview
This project explores the **psychological and behavioral impact of binge-watching on Netflix viewers** using the *Netflix Life Impact Dataset (NLID)*. The objective is to understand how user habits, content type, and viewing duration relate to their emotional and behavioral outcomes.

Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, this notebook identifies patterns, correlations, and statistical summaries that highlight the effects of excessive content consumption.
